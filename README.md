# Online Furniture Catalog

## Overview
The **Online Furniture Catalog** is a **COS104 group project** developed by **Team G-13**.  
It is a simple web-based application built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

The goal of the project is not to create a production-level app, but to **practice key web development concepts** such as modular JavaScript, filtering logic using classes, project structuring, and team collaboration.  

---

## Objectives
The main objectives of this coursework project are to:

- Solidify our understanding of **modular JavaScript**.  
- Implement **filtering logic** using object-oriented principles.  
- Practice **clean project structure** and separation of concerns.  
- Improve **team collaboration** through version control (Git/GitHub).  

---

## Features
- **Navigation Section** – Quick access to catalog pages (Home, Shop, About, Contact).  
- **Catalog Section** – Browse and filter furniture items by category (e.g., Chairs, Tables, Sofas).  
- **Filtering Logic** – Uses JavaScript classes and modular code to dynamically show products.  
- **Contact Form** – Validated with both HTML5 attributes and custom JavaScript logic for clearer error handling.  

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Page structure and semantic layout.  
- **CSS** – Styling, layout, and responsive design.  
- **JavaScript** –  
  - Modular code structure (`import`/`export`)  
  - Filtering and catalog management  
  - Custom form validation

## Modularity
This project highlights **separation of concerns** in JavaScript:

- `catalogFiltering.js` → Handles displaying and filtering products.  
- `formValidation.js` → Handles input validation and custom error messages.  
- `furnitureData.js` → Contains product data and reusable class logic.  
- `main.js` → Coordinates everything as the entry point.

## Conclusion
The Online Furniture Catalog is a **course project for COS104**.  
It demonstrates our learning of **modular JavaScript, filtering logic, and project structuring** while working as a team.  

The catalog provides a simple but practical way to browse items online, while serving as a foundation for building stronger web development skills.
