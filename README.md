Our group project is an Online Furniture Catalog, a web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to simplify the process of browsing and selecting furniture items online. Instead of relying on traditional, time-consuming methods, users can easily search, filter, and view detailed information about specific furniture pieces.

Objectives
The main objectives of the project are:

To simplify furniture browsing for users.

To improve decision-making through organized display and search.

To create a user-friendly interface with clear navigation.

Features

Navigation section – provides easy access to different parts of the catalog.

Catalog section – users can browse and search for furniture items.

For example, searching for tables will only display tables, while searching for chairs will only display chairs.

Contact section – includes a validation form created with JavaScript.

If the user enters invalid information, the system detects it and prompts them with an error message (e.g., required fields must be filled).

Technology Used

HTML – for structure and layout of the catalog pages.

CSS – for styling and improving the user interface.

JavaScript – for interactivity, search functionality, and form validation.

Conclusion
The Online Furniture Catalog provides a simple and effective way for users to explore and select furniture items online. It improves user experience by making browsing faster, more organized, and interactive.
