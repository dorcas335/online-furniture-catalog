The **Online Furniture Catalog** is a COS104 group project developed by **Team G-13**, a web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to simplify the process of browsing and selecting furniture items online. Instead of relying on traditional, time-consuming methods, users can easily search, filter, and view detailed information about specific furniture pieces.

Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:

To simplify furniture browsing for users.

To improve decision-making through organized display and search.

To create a user-friendly interface with clear navigation.

Demonstrate how basic web technologies can be combined to create a functional project.

Features

Navigation section – provides easy access to different parts of the catalog.

Catalog section – users can browse and search for specific  furniture items.

For example, searching for tables will only display tables, while searching for chairs will only display chairs.

Contact section 

- Uses HTML required attribute to ensure no field is left empty.

– includes a Javascript validation to check input formats.

- Invalid or missing inputs triggers an alert before submission.

If the user enters invalid information, the system detects it and prompts them with an error message (e.g., required fields must be filled).

**Session storage support**

- Stores tenporary data (e.g. search queries or form inputs) within the browser session.

-  Data is cleared automatically once the browser tab is closed

  **Responsive design**

  - Styled with css to ensure usability on different devices.


Technology Used

HTML – for structurind the catalog and web pages.

CSS – for styling, responsive layouts and improving the user interface.

JavaScript – for interactivity, search functionality, and form validation and session storage.

Technical Highlights

This project demonstrates the following wweb development skills:

DOM manipulatiom : Dynamically updating page content based on user input

Form validation: Using HTML5 required attribute and custom Javascript validation.

Session storage : Temporarily storing user data within the browser session.

Responsive web design : Ensuring usability across devices using CSS media queries

Search filtering logic : Displaying relevant catalog items based on keywords.

Usage

Navigate through sections using the navigation bar.

Use the search bar in the catalog section to filter items by keyword.

Explore furniture details in an organized view.

Fill in the contact form:

If fields are empty → the HTML required attribute prevents submission.

If formats are incorrect → JavaScript validation shows an alert.


Session storage ensures temporary user data (like recent searches) is available until the browser tab is closed.

Conclusion

The Online Furniture Catalog is a course project for COS104.

It demonstrates our learning of **modular javascript, filtering logic, and project structuring** while working as a team.

The catalog provides a simple but practical way to browse items online, while serving as a foundation for building stronger web development skills.
